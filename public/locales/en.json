  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about Morphe",
    "q1": "What apps can Morphe patch?",
    "a1": "You can patch any app you want. As long as you want YouTube, YouTube Music, or Reddit. We're constantly working on expanding support to more apps.",
    "q2": "Is Morphe safe?",
    "a2": "As safe as modifying obfuscated bytecode can be. All source code for Morphe is open source and free for anyone to inspect. Our community actively reviews and contributes to the codebase.",
    "q3": "Will Morphe brick my phone?",
    "a3": "Only if your phone decides to brick itself. Otherwise your device will be fine. Morphe only modifies app packages and doesn't touch system files.",
    "q4": "Can I customize apps to my preference?",
    "a4": "Yes, but don't blame Morphe if your app becomes too customized for you to handle. It's recommended to customize up to your preference level and no more.",
    "q5": "What's Morphe's privacy policy?",
    "q6": "Why the name Morphe?",
    "a6": "Because \"Android App Modification And Transformation Tool\" (AAMATT) is not very catchy. And because Morphe implies it morphs your apps into something better.",
    "q7": "Is Morphe magic?",
    "a7": "No. But also yes. It's advanced bytecode manipulation that feels like magic.",
    "q8": "Can I contribute to Morphe?",
    "a8-part1": "Yes! See the contribution guidelines in our",
    "a8-github": "GitHub repos",
